# SHA256

A simple implementation of SHA256 in Haskell.

Not clean enough to be a library, but rather developed as a
benchmark of how a purely algorithmical function could be
translated in a functional way.

It was also a way to learn Haskell, so it does not use monads
for what could have been a cleaner implementation
